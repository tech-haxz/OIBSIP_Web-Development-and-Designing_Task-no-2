                From torchbearer to transformer, the late Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata played shepherd and sentinel
                while guiding the Tata group into a new age, and did it in his own distinctive style.

                <p id="biography-text">
                    Ratan Naval Tata, born on December 28, 1937, in Surat, India, was a prominent Indian industrialist and
                    philanthropist. He served as the Chairman of Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and played a pivotal role in
                    transforming the Tata Group into a global powerhouse. Under his leadership, the group expanded its
                    footprint internationally, acquiring companies like Jaguar Land Rover and Corus Steel. Ratan Tata was
                    known for his visionary approach, commitment to innovation, and dedication to corporate social
                    responsibility. He was also instrumental in launching the Tata Nano, the world's most affordable car.
                    Beyond business, he was deeply involved in philanthropy through the Tata Trusts, supporting education,
                    healthcare, and rural development initiatives. Ratan Tata's legacy continues to inspire future
                    generations of entrepreneurs and leaders.
